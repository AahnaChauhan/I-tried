     14th of June 2025. The day forever etched in our souls, a day to always remember no matter what, a date which is already a part of our lives.<br>Trust me I might forget my own name but Tanmay, I will never forget how you caught me wayyy off my guard with those paper rings. They are really special along with the ones that i gave to you. These rings were the beginning of our marriage. They are the reason we are married in our heads and i cant lie it was the sweetest it could ever be.<br>All along i have realised that this one, among all, is my favourite story to tell and i will be disappointed in myself if i ever lose even a single chance to preach it.<br>Yes, it is THAAAT PEAK:)

It is tattooed so deep, i dont think i'm ever gonna forget it in my life.<br>Every handplacement, every pattern of your breath, every curve in your voice and you silhouette. It is soooooo very nice to recall everything, i just wish you could see my smile right now ommmggg!!

      I still couldn't believe that i told my mom about you. I never imagined it would happen. But honestly, it is the best unexpected thing to ever happen!<br>This feeling is something i only could have imagined and you made it come true for me. It feels so mature in a good way and i am really so glad about it.<br>Our first date.<br>It is one of the most magical experience of my life. You came to my house to pick me up, met my family, we had lunch together. I wouldn't want it any other way.<br>Thank you honey, you're my precious boy.

      We have evolved so much together since the day we met. It brings me to tears everytime, thinking how precious bond we shared.<br>Now we're two grown ups, against the world, together. My sweetie, without you, there's just darkness, my world rips off of the light. And you, feel like warm sun on my skin on a chilly day.<br>At all times even if I dont say it, all i want is to run to you into your arms, and feel all the love i have ever been robbed off, again.<br>You feeding me from your own hands would always be a way to make me melt. You make me feel things I never thought could be felt.<br> And again, I adore you, my sugarcane<3
